We've tweaked Ooetksh's version of [VRGIN](https://github.com/Ooetksh/VRGIN) for HS2.

For compatibility with the latest VR devices and to facilitate development, we aim to upgrade older SteamVR 1.x versions that utilize legacy input and tracking systems to 2.x versions.

Since the development goal is to exclusively support HS2 based on the Unity 2018.4 engine, compatibility with other Unity engines cannot be guaranteed.
